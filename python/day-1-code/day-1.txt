# Introduction to Programming

Programming is the process of instructing computers on what tasks to perform. Since computers are essentially "dumb" devices, they can only follow the commands we give them. Programming enables us to communicate with computers and tell them what to do.

# What is Python?

Python is a **dynamically typed**, **general-purpose programming language** that supports both **object-oriented** and **functional programming** paradigms. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1989**.

Python is a high-level, **interpreted** language, which means it does not need to be compiled before running, making the development process faster and more flexible.
